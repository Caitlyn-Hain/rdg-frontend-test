# rdg-frontend-test
Test project for potential hires.

This project is intended to evaluate your interpretation of a provided design to front-end code. We will be looking not only at what the end result looks like in the browser and in the code, but also your initiative to learn new things and go above and beyond the minimum requirements.

You have been provided with desktop and mobile mockups for a web page, along with the HTML of said page. It is your job to build the responsive styling according to the mockups. You may choose to use CSS, SASS, or something else to execute the styles, along with JQuery, Javascript, and other libraries to achieve functional behaviors.



TIPS, NOTES, ETC.

1. Clone the Repository
2. Download the Repository

USING SASS: 
At RDG, we use SASS for our styling instead of CSS. This allows us greater flexibility by nesting and variables, and ultimately using fewer lines of code by way of mixins. If you decide to use SASS as your styling language of choice (but it's completely new to you), here are some links to help you get started.

Directions to install SASS:
